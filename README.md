# PsychoPy Pupil Utilities
A set of PsychoPy classes which are used to visualize calibration and surface markers. The calibration markers are drawn using multiple Circle objects on top of each other. The surface markers use pre-rendered images generated by [`make_square_markers.py`](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil-helpers/blob/master/make_square_markers.py).
